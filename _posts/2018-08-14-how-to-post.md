Welcome to our new site! If you want to add to it, the site is completely open-source and runs using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Please make pull requests to the master branch should you wish to write a post and the CryptoSoc team will review and approve your changes.

As aptly put by Jekyll themselves:
> To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

You can even put code in your posts just like regular markdown:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Some things to write about:
* Crypto or AI projects you've done
* Related philosophical ideas
* Related news
* Upcoming events
