We recommend everyone begins with some fundamentals of developing your own applications on your computer by starting with the [Fundamentals Sequence](#collapse-1). This sequence introduces many core concepts that will set you up to learn about AI and/or blockchains. You can browse all of the sequences on the left panel.

Once you have learnt about those concepts we have two sequences to choose from:

- [Artificial Intelligence Sequence](#collapse-3)
- [Blockchain Sequence](#collapse-2)

These sequences will give you both a theoretical and practical walkthrough of the topic. Each tutorial is a bite-sized introduction to a topic. At the end of the sequence, you will have the skills to build your own blockchain based application or build your own neural network.
