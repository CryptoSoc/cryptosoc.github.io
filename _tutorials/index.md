We recommend everyone begins with some fundamentals of developing your own applications on your computer by starting with the __Fundamentals Sequence__. This sequence introduces many core concepts that will set you up to learn about AI and/or blockchains. You can browse all of the sequences on the left panel.

Once you have learnt about those concepts we have two sequences to choose from:

- __Artificial Intelligence Sequence__
- __Blockchain Sequence__

These sequences will give you both a theoretical and practical walkthrough of the topic. Each tutorial is a bite-sized introduction to a topic. At the end of the sequence, you will have the skills to build your own blockchain based application or build your own neural network.
